> Simplified Workflow Creation 
> State Management
> Event-Driven Architecture
> Flexible Control Flow

# Flow (Sequential or Parallel processing)
 > @start() decorator
 > @listen() decorator

# State Management
 > Unstructured
 > Structured

# State Persistance with @persist decorator
 > Class level
 > Method level

 > @router decorator for conditional routing

# Adding Agents to Flow

# Creating Flows with Crews (with CLI Commands)
------------------------------------------------------------------
# CLI - Commands for creating FLOWS
# Create a Project Scaffolding with a Demo Flow & Crew (PoemCrew)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Create the flow with the first crew: 
# crewai create flow flow_demo

Change the directory: 
 # cd flow_demo

## Install dependencies
 # crewai install

## activate the virtual environment
 # .venv/Scripts/activate

## Add the `.env` file with all the secret API keys

## Execute the Flow
 # crewai run
Alternatively
 # crewai flow kickoff

Add a second crew to the existing flow: 
# crewai flow add-crew my_second_crew

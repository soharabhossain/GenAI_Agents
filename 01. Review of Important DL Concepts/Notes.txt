How to preprocess a Corpus(Dataset)
-------------------------------------
Steps:
1. Extract the words from the text (word_tokenizer)
We have to build a vocabulary of all the unique words (Python dictionary)
key -> integer values
value-> words

2. Every word has to be integer encoded (Tokenizer)
 actor >  34
 34: actor

happy > 100
the movie is great
1 12 6 200

3. Pad sequences to equal length

4. Embedding - dense vector representation of a word (when we will build the LSTM network)
 34  > [0.32  -0.45  0.55  0.9  -0.5] (hints: Word Embedding - Word2Vec, GloVE)
